# Deimos

A GameProvider to be able to use the Fabric modding toolchain to make and use mods for the Mars
program.

Depends on [Fabric Loader](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-loader/) by FabricMC and mods 
[Mars](https://courses.missouristate.edu/kenvollmar/mars/) by Pete Sanderson and Kenneth Vollmar.

## Usage

- Download the latest Deimos launcher from the [releases page](https://github.com/illogicWorks/deimos/releases).

- Put your Mars jar in the same folder

- Double click the Deimos launcher to launch it!

You can add mods to the `mods` folder it'll create in the folder it's in at first launch
